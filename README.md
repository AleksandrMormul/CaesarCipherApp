# Caesar cipher

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.


## Project structure

- backend/server/ - Django settings
- backend/caesar_cipher/ - Caesar cipher app
- frontend/client/ - React application
- Makefile - commands for launching application or executing some actions
- README.md - general project documentation
- Pipfile - project requirements that should be installed to launch application
- Pipfile.lock - autogenerated version of requirements,
  that contains proper library versions

- */__init__.py - this file can be found in many folders.
  It shows that this folder includes python package and can be used to export
  different variables and functions.

## Useful development commands

- `make dep` - Install dependencies
- `make runEnv` - Run pipenv virtualenv
- `make server` - Run backend
- `make client` - Run frontend
